# Screenshot, don't link

As one of my Twitter friends [said](https://twitter.com/h4emtfr/status/807116063691460608) *"The problem with fake news is that the vast majority of ppl reposting them know they are fake."*

I keep seeing well-intentioned people sharing fake / ridiculous / highly-objectionable news articles, with the aim of
ridiculing it with a scathing comment. The trouble is, *they're still linking people to the actual content*, which
means the "publication" gets more clicks and more advertising $$$. This incentivises these "publications" to make more and more of this garbage, outrageous content.

Stop funding it; stop linking it. *Screenshot, don't link*.

## What about other articles?

Totally link to that! If you're not sharing something just to complain about it, keep doing that. We need to fund (real) journalism more than ever.

## I don't think this will solve the problem

You're right that it's just one small part of it. Really we need to help fix revenue generation for real journalism, to help fix the incentives for good. This is something I'm thinking about and I know some very smart people who are working on this. If you have further ideas or feedback, please [get in touch](https://twitter.com/poshaughnessy).
