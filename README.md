# Screenshot, don't link

I keep seeing well-intentioned people sharing ridiculous / fake / objectionable news articles, with the aim of
ridiculing it with a scathing comment. The trouble is, *they're still linking people to the actual content*, which
means the "publication" gets more clicks and more advertising $$$.

Stop funding it; stop linking it. *Screenshot, don't link*.
